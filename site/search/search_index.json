With Airflow we're doing all this under one roof with monitoring and visualization built in. Airflow uses something called a DAG (Directed acyclic graph) Airflow is primerilly written with Python scrips that compose of the below imports from airflow import DAG from datetime import datetime We need to use datetime as airflow runs certain operations on a time schedule, an example is below with DAG(\"my_dag\", start_date=datetime(2022, 1, 1), schedule_interval=\"@daily\") as dag: What happens here is we: Define the dag with a name my_dag Set a start time that the Dag is effective from 2022, january the first Set a schuedle time Daily at midnight (see below table) Can also be a cron job We have a set few options of built in timings we can use, or a cron job. Presets Preset Meaning Cron None Don\u2019t schedule, use for exclusively \u201cexternally triggered\u201d DAGs N/a @once Schedule once and only once N/a @hourly Run once an hour at the beginning of the hour 0 * * * * @daily Run once a day at midnight 0 0 * * * @weekly Run once a week at midnight on Sunday morning 0 0 * * 0 @monthly Run once a month at midnight of the first day of the month 0 0 1 * * @yearly Run once a year at midnight of January 1 0 0 1 1 * Note: use schedule_interval=None opposed to directly quoting with \"none\" Another way to set out the config is like below: default_args = { 'owner': 'airflow', 'depends_on_past': False, 'start_date': datetime(2015, 12, 1), 'email': ['airflow@example.com'], 'email_on_failure': False, 'email_on_retry': False, 'retries': 1, 'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5), 'schedule_interval': '@hourly', } dag = DAG('tutorial', catchup=False, default_args=default_args) Each section is self explanatory (provided you can understand the general key value pari's name) Some are not, I will explain below depends_on_past depends_on_past (boolean) when set to True, keeps a task from getting triggered if the previous schedule for the task hasn\u2019t succeeded. retry_delay The delay after a failure before it should try the DAG again owner Who owns the file permissions and who the program runs under The catchup is quite advanced so we will deep dive it below Catchup We need to make some assumptions here Assume Start date of 2020-1-1 Start time of 6am Schedule interval of hourly The action will happen at 2020-1-1 7am Use the equation below Trigger Point \u2192 start_date + { schedule_interval } \u2192 till the end. In simple terms If you set the create date a year ago, and upload it will create many many dag instances, to prevent this we set catchup=False The below explains this in way too much detail, but it's good to have In the above image we are initial config where everything is fine and our DAG Run happened at 6. Then we paused the DAG. Here we see that since at the next schedule DAG run was paused hence start_date for the schedule is not available. At the next schedule the same happened (DAG run was not triggered). Now we enable or schedule the DAG run from console In the above diagram we see at the next schedule previously missed DAG Runs were triggered. Notice start_date is the next schedule (9). While the Execution dates are the actual ones, if you notice, start_date are same for the last three DAG runs. This denotes backfill. So first DAG run for execution date of 6 happened then for 7 and then for 8.","title":"Airflow basics"},{"location":"automation/ansible/basics/","text":"I always create a folder for new tasks, so installing Nginx Ansible | |-----Nginx | |---hosts | |---nginx.yaml etc Change the directory to the task at hand, so here it's installing Nginx Create a file called ansible.cfg and place the below in the file.

How do you trade off between resilliance, performance and cost whilst not comprimising on security What is cloud and why do we need it? Before the cloud a company would have to do 'Peak load provisioning' where you buy servers for the peak load Before cloud the cost of purchasing infrastructure was high, and an upfront cost The infrastrucutre was under-utilized and you need a dedicated infrastrucutre team When you use the cloud you 'Provision' and 'rent' resources from the provider. For this you rent them and then return them back to the 'pool' once used. This is called Elasticity and 'On demand Provisioning' Trading capital expense for Variables Expense. You are benifiting from the 'Economic of Scale' where the cloud provider gets the best deals for you. You no longer need to spend money running a datacentre. Allows you to go global in minutes. GCP is one of the top 3 cloud providers, the other are AWS and Azure GCP provides 200+ services, and has provided to be reliable and secure. Is it the 'cleanest' cloud, as it's carbon neutral We move to the cloud due to on demand cloud provisioning. When we talk about cloud applications, we talk about multiple GCP services. Course content: Regions and Zones Imagine your application is deployed in the London Region. This means that users from other locations will have High Latency. If the DC crashes, your application goes down: Low Availability. If the entire Region of London is unavailable, we will have the same architecture in a separate Region. This is what we want to do with the cloud deployment, to have them as close to the user as possible, deployment across multiple regions. Understanding Regions and Zones in GCP All the cloud providers provide us with Regions. Google has 20 regions A region is a specific geographical location to host your resources Advantages: High Availability Low Latency Global Footprint Adherence to Government Regulations How do we deploy HA in one geographical location? within each region has multiple zones Each region has 3 (or more) availability zones Each zone has one or more 'Discreet clusters' Each Zone has one or more Datacentre. these zones are all connected with low latency connections. Google Compute engine Features When you want to deploy applicaitons, you need servers. In order to deploy to the cloud you need to deploy to a Virtual machine In order to provision a machine, you need to use Google Compute engine GCE helps you to: Create and manage the lifecycle of Virtual machines Load balancing and autoscaling instances Attach storage Manage network connectivity Creating an instance There are a lot of details you need to give You need to (and have the option to) give: name Labels Region and Zone OS Firewall Understanding machine types There are some important choices we made: Hardware OS When we talk about the hardware, we need to understand the Machine type and Machine family General Purpose: E2, N2, N2D, N1 Best price-performance ratio running Web applicatoins and small-medium sized databases, dev enciroments Memory Optimized Ultra high memory workloads M2,M1 Large in memory Database Compute Optimized Compute Intensive workloads C2 Gaming applications First choice is what machine family, then the machine type e2-standard-2 e2 - Machine type family Standard - Workload 2 - Number of CPU's Machine name vCPU's Memory Maximum number of PD's Max total PD size (TB) Local SSD Egress bandwith (Gbps) e2-standard-2 2 8 128 257 No 4 e2-standard-4 4 16 128 257 No 8 e2-standard-8 8 32 128 257 No 16 e2-standard-16 16 64 128 257 No 16 e2-standard-32 32 128 128 257 No 16 Memory, Disk and Networking capabilities increase with the vCPU's Second question is what OS do we want to run - This is chosen with the Image We can pick a public Image, which are maintained by Google or opensource third parties Understanding IP addressing in GCP External IP address are Internet addressable, can be reached over the internet Internal IP address are internal to the corperate network, so a VM with the IP of 10.128.0.2 address isnt reachable from your network You cant have 2 instances with the same public IP You have have 2 separate corporate networks with the same internal network To get a static IP address, we go to VPC networks > External IP address Here we chose what network tier as well as version to use Things to note: Static IP can be switched to another VM instance in the same project Static IP remains attached even after a reboot Static IP's are billed when you are not using it! Templates We can speed up the creation of instances by using a template It's used to create VM's as well as Managed instance groups We can define the Machine Type, Image, labels and Start up script etc once then apply to many! Once the template is created, we cant update it. We need to copy it You can specify an Image family which will pick the most recent non deprecated image. There is no cost associated with creating a template Images Installing OS patches at boot can take a while to boot the instance Create an image with the patches pre-installed You can create an image from: Instance Persistant Disk Snapshot Image File in gcs Can be shared accross projects Deprecate old images (And specify a replacement image) Harden an image - Customize images to your corperate standard Startup scripts take time, where as using a snapshot makes it quicker.

Regions and Zones When we architect our application we need to deploy our application closes to our users, as well as spanning multiple zones. Google cloud is split in to Regions and Zones Region A geographical location that the DC sits in Example being europe-west2 Zone A specific Data Centre in the Region Example being: europe-west2-c Some applications (Like the ones I am working on currently) - We are not allowed to store Date outside of the border of the United Kingdom. Whilst google don't release information about their exact locations, we are able to make a good guess it's in Slough These data centers are connected via High speed connections (Fibre cables) GCP Services Encryption Allows Google Managed keys Allows uploading your own keys VPC Secure private cloud VPC Peering Peers VPC's between projects and accounts Routes traffic VPC Sharing Allows projects to put resources on a shared VPC Hybrid Connectivity Secure private connection between your premise and the cloud Data Loss Detect sensitive Data and scrub it Security Command Centre Allows us to view all security issues Binary Authorization Allows only certain docker images to run Web Security Scanner Scans internal web apps for security vulnerabilities IAM & Admin IAM Identity and Access Management Who can do what, when and with what Security at google and how it helps What google does to secure your app/ data How google does all these Security Mechanisms at different layers Shared Responsibility model Tools provided by GCP Regulatory Compliance Why trust google They have over 7 billion users Security is a main concern for them Your applicaiton is deployed in the same infrastructure as Google.com and google workspaces applications They have dedicated engineers 24/7 working for security How google Secure their infrastructure Hardware layer Less than 1% of google employees have access to the Data Centre Google builds all their own hardware Routers, switches, etc IAM Identity and access management Allows users to do some stuff and blocks them to do others User Management Google Account authentication SMAL support Enforce user rules 2fa Minimum password Storage data Encrypts all your data Keys: Google managed by default Customer Supplied Customer Managed IAP Identity Aware Proxy Secures Applications via google login Built in DDOS prevention DLP Inspects Data Can be configured to Find and Redact Transform data Can be used to re-identify it VPC Firewall rules Cloud Armour Ingress/ Egress rules Operations Logging Monitoring Tracing Profiling Regulatory Compliance Encryption, hardware, VPC firewall is technical aspect of security Compliance is another important factor Google cloud follows these standards Shared Responsibility Model Google is responsible for securing some aspects of your deployment, like the underlying hardware/ infra, where as you need to ensure that your application is patched (At a bare minimum) The above chart shows who plays more roles around where, and by whom We can see that for On-prem, it's entirely your problem Where as when we go to Software As A Service (SaaS) - All the underlying infrastructure, usage, deployment etc is the providers problem. Cloud Identity There are 5 'Cloud Identities': Google Account Service Account Google workspace Cloud Identity Domain Google Groups The above are then able to interact with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) In every single identity, they are similar to Email address' Cloud Identity is a Managed service that manages users. Cloud Identity - Google Workspace This is the renames product previously called G-Suit Similar to Office 365 Slides Sheets Docs Etc You can get a verified domain Domain like breadnet.co.uk - Verify ownership You get complete user management for all the users under the domain Free 15 days trial, then $6 per user per month Access via admin.google.com If you already have Google workspace, then it automatically verifies your google cloud domain Sections have been skipped on Udemy as knowledge is pre-existing Admin Console The below section is about the google cloud admin console Resource Hierarchy At the top you have the Organization Below the ORG you can have folders Below folders you have projects At each level you are able to set IAM and policies You can nest folders up to 10 ( ten ) levels deep. A parent folder cannot contain more than 300 folders. This refers to direct child folders only. Those child folders can, in turn, contain additional folders or projects. Folder display names must be unique within the same level of the hierarchy. Organization Policies For arguments sake, we will look at how to enable/ disable 3 policies: Disable Service Account Creation Enforce Uniform bucket level access Skip Default network creation How to Enable IAM > Organization Policies > Disable Service account creation Here we are able to define what level the policy applies at. How to disable on a project when it's inheriting If you need to remove something that is inherited, you select Customize > Enforcement > Off IAM Intro IAM stands for Identity and Access management Defines: Who can do what and on which Who: Identity Member Email What Roles Collections of permissions Which Resources: Compute Engine app engine Bigquery etc Roles There are 3 types of roles in Google Cloud Platform Roles are defined as a Collection of Permissions Primitive These are super simple roles, and should usually be avoided as best as possible Owner Editor Viewer Pre-defined These roles are roles on a single service Examples: Compute admin Network Viewer BQ Job User Custom roles These are roles you make for your org or project based on specifics from predefined roles, They usually follow the layout like service.resource-type.verb","title":"Google Security - Page 1"},{"location":"certifications/google-certs/workspace-admin/managing-gsuit/","text":"Enabling services for everyone You are able to enable and disable services for everyone under the apps section. This can be configured per OU This is much like AD where permissions and status is inherited from the top level. To enable/ disable a service you select the OU and then disable it there If only one user requires access to a service, you should add them to a group. You will want to create that group to have access:restricted then under the service you will need to search for it: When creating groups: It can and will take up to 24 hours Groups cant be used to deny access, the order of presidence is OU then group Access groups can contain users from any OU Ensure you use a naming practice like ag.<name> for groups (where ag is access group) Service Release Track Google has 2 release tracks you can subscribe to: Rapid release This is the track where releases are rolled out as soon as they are released to the public. These products have gone through the same QC as other apps but your users will see them at the same time you do. Scheduled release (Recommended and enabled by default) this gives you extra time to train your users on things that have been released. Releases are made only on Tuesdays at least a week after the rapid release For most gsuit orgs, you want the scheduled release track for stability. (see side bar for calendar) To edit this, it's a global option so will be under profile for the company You can set the track for both features and products Configure Common User Settings You are able to set (as usual) settings for Gmail on a OU based structure where you can disable and enable features. This would include features like: Confidential mode Gmail offline Mail delegation Smart compiose As usual these things can be controlled at an OU level and can have over-rides You can enable Gmail labs which has experimental features: Enable G Suite Sync for Outlook You are able to disable and enable Synch for Outlook per OU This can be found under 'End user access' and can be applied per OU Compliance Under Advanced settings you have the ability to create compliance settings for the users. This can be set per OU: Auto deletion OCR Archiving Appending footer Restricting domains Attachment compliance TLS MTS-STS Email routing Here you can set rules on what to do with emails that contain certain files. You can: Modify Add headers Add subject Change route Change Recipient Bypass spam filter Remove attachments Deliver to more people Encrypt Reject Quarantine From the gmail sergice settings page you cant set default language. This is set globally Users set: Display language for their inbox pop3 accounts Sharing calendars You will want to ensure that only free and busy info is enabled for external users. To manage sharing you will need to edit the calendar from your account. Invite people from there and then set their permissions from that tab. As as admin in calendar control you can set: Highest level of sharing for externals Default level of internal sharing Google Drive You will want to set the best sharing permissions for Drive. As usual this can be done at an OU level. You can set an option where you can share externally, but only with whitelisted domains. This is important if you run a secretive business. These options override all options for shared drives. You have the ability to transfer ownership of all documents. This is under settings for Drive and docs > transfer ownership. This can also be done under the drive API Restore Deleted Files Google keeps files for 25 days, in which you're able to restore them. Go to the user's tab and select 'Restore data' then pick the date window and then the Application. Once done the files will appear again. Offline access to documents Users can be granted access to 'Offline access to documents' via OU or group as usual. This can be found under Apps > google workspace > Settings for drive and docs > Feature and Applications > offline Enable this for users under an OU or group. You will require google chrome and the offline sync plugin for this to work Stream or Sync files There are 2 ways you can access files in drive: Drive file stream This streams the files from the cloud to your computer Backup and Sync This is the software you've installed for google backup This is enabled under Features and Applications Things to note: You can allow file stream and backup for users. If they are running a backup whilst streaming it will ask them to stop. If you enable download links for both, then only file stream link is allowed Shared Drive Creation Shared drive creation needs to be enabled from Sharing centre in Drive and Docs.

Users have their own contacts that are not shared with the org. --- Admin roles: Admin roles are roles given to an admin that allows them to perform actions in the gsuit org. You can give a user roles to manage users or to the whole domain To assign an admin role you can select the user's account under admin.google.com then assign roles.

In this case we will use the google_compute_instance.vm_instance which tells google, bro, spin me up a vm Just like everything else, we need to give it a name. This not only helps with admin tasks, but we can call it by name for later tasks! Then we need to pick what machine type to use! I am going to be using these found here We can add tags. This is useful for sorting machines by production, pre deployment and dev. Next thing we will need to do is add the boot disk.

This is all good and well for internal applications but useless for external applicaitons. In order to access the port and network of the container, we must use the -p command which maps the port to the container Example: docker run -p 80:5000 kodekloud/simple-webapp This maps external port 80 to internal port 5000 Seurprisingly you cant map to the same port the same time.

Examples: # Check to see if I can create pods in any namespace kubectl auth can-i create pods --all-namespaces # Check to see if I can list deployments in my current namespace kubectl auth can-i list deployments.apps # Check to see if I can do everything in my current namespace (\"*\" means all) kubectl auth can-i '*' '*' # Check to see if I can get the job named \"bar\" in namespace \"foo\" kubectl auth can-i list jobs.batch/bar -n foo # Check to see if I can read pod logs kubectl auth can-i get pods --subresource = log # Check to see if I can access the URL /logs/ kubectl auth can-i get /logs/ # List all allowed actions in namespace \"foo\" kubectl auth can-i --list --namespace = foo Options: -A, --all-namespaces = false: If true, check the specified action in all namespaces. --list = false: If true, prints all allowed actions. --no-headers = false: If true, prints allowed actions without headers -q, --quiet = false: If true, suppress output and just return the exit code. --subresource = '' : SubResource such as pod/log or deployment/scale Usage: kubectl auth can-i VERB [ TYPE | TYPE/NAME | NONRESOURCEURL ] [ options ] Use \"kubectl options\" for a list of global command-line options ( applies to all commands ) .","title":"Command Reference"},{"location":"kb/kubernetes/rbac-testing/#current-user","text":"","title":"Current user"},{"location":"kb/kubernetes/rbac-testing/#create-deployment","text":"Note This assumes namespace is default kubectl auth can-i create deployment","title":"Create deployment"},{"location":"kb/kubernetes/rbac-testing/#create-deployment-in-different-namespace","text":"kubectl auth can-i create deployment --namespace bradley","title":"Create deployment in different namespace"},{"location":"kb/kubernetes/rbac-testing/#other-user","text":"","title":"Other user"},{"location":"kb/kubernetes/rbac-testing/#check-if-current-user-can-create-deployment","text":"kubectl auth can-i create deployment --namespace <namespace> -as <username> # (1)! <username> needs to appear as it does in the RoleBinding","title":"Check if current user can create deployment"},{"location":"kb/kubernetes/rbac-testing/#get-list-of-actions-other-user-can-do","text":"kubectl auth can-i --list --as <username> # (1)! <username> needs to appear as it does in the RoleBinding","title":"Get list of actions other user can do"},{"location":"kb/kubernetes/service-account-with-workload-id/","text":"Kubernetes Service account with Workload ID apiVersion : v1 kind : ServiceAccount metadata : name : bradley annotations : iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account : <gservice account email> You will need to grant the GCP SA the below roles PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog [ NAMESPACE/KSA ] As well as: roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser These need to be granted to the GCP SA in GCP See Workload Identity (Page coming soon)","title":"Workload ID KSA"},{"location":"kb/kubernetes/service-account-with-workload-id/#kubernetes-service-account-with-workload-id","text":"apiVersion : v1 kind : ServiceAccount metadata : name : bradley annotations : iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account : <gservice account email> You will need to grant the GCP SA the below roles PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog [ NAMESPACE/KSA ] As well as: roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser These need to be granted to the GCP SA in GCP See Workload Identity (Page coming soon)","title":"Kubernetes Service account with Workload ID"},{"location":"kb/kubernetes/sleeper/","text":"Why Sometimes we need to run a pod on the cluster to exec in to and test things, like web requests etc How Default Service account Environments from config map apiVersion : v1 kind : Pod metadata : name : sleeper spec : containers : - name : alpine image : alpine:latest # Just spin & wait forever command : [ \"/bin/sh\" , \"-c\" , \"--\" ] args : [ \"while true;

There's no need at all to fiddle with GRUB nor any manual file removal. The configuration set up in /etc/networking files and directories will survive reboots . These are the verified steps: Check the actual interface names you are interested in with ip l for the links (aka interfaces) and with ip a for addresses. Install ifupdown with sudo apt -y install ifupdown . Purge netplan with sudo apt -y purge netplan.io . Configure /etc/network/interfaces and/or /etc/network/interfaces.d accordingly to your needs ( man 5 interfaces can be of some help with examples). Restart the networking service with sudo systemctl restart networking; systemctl status networking or sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart; /etc/init.d/networking status . The output of the status command should mention active as its status. The command ip a will show whether the expected network configuration has been applied. Optionally, manually purge the remants of the netplan configuration files with sudo rm -vfr /usr/share/netplan /etc/netplan .

IT'S INSECURE AND DOES NOT FOLLOW BEST PRACTICES. Prereqs: I am not a security expert, I am a sysadmin. The security of your server is up to you. Do basic things like enable ssh keys and lock down ingress ports with ufw or iptables. What ever angles your dangle. I am not a docker expert. I am a sysadmin which means I can use google (I think? bleh) so if you see anything whack in this, feel free to email me (webmaster[at]breadnet[dot]co[dot]uk) Comment: 3rd may 2020: After running this for a few days it's come to my attention that for this to be viable and be able to transcode you will need a slightly more powerful host. Whilst this does feel like a kick in the nuts, its not. There are lots of technologies that still work here. You will need: S3 compatible bucket - I suggest wasabi but you can also use Min.io if you're in to FOSS (wasabi has a 30 day free 1tb trial) Cloud vps somewhere with reasonable connection and sub 20ms ping to the bucket location. Not needed but is nice. Internet should be around 30mbps at min Ability to read and copy and paste. The first step First we will spin up a digital ocean droplet but you can use what ever VPS provider you want. Once the VPs is up and you're logged in run the below to update the sources and crap. should not take too long. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade Once that's done, install rclone sudo apt-get install rclone Now we need to configure the s3 bucket. I am using wasabi like I said to begin with, but some parts are universal to all s3 compatible storage options. Login to wasabi console at https://console.wasabisys.com Once logged in, go to buckets and create bucket - name it what you want. call it Jeff for all I care :) Now that your bucket is created, we need to create a policy that will later be applied to a user. Go to policies on the left hand nav bar and create new policy (top right) Name your policy something like jeff-RO (where the appending characters reference the permissions, here it's Read Only) The below policy is full access to that bucket. { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"AWS\": \"*\" }, \"Action\": [ \"s3:GetBucketLocation\", \"s3:ListBucket\", \"s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads\" ], \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::jeff\" }, { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"AWS\": \"*\" }, \"Action\": \"s3:GetObject\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::jeff/*\" } ] } Below is full rw access { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"s3:ListAllMyBuckets\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::*\" }, { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"s3:*\", \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:s3:::jeff\", \"arn:aws:s3:::jeff/*\" ] } ] } Once your policy is created you can now move on to creating the user. Go to users and then click 'create user' and follow though the prompts. Click API access: Now follow though the prompts till you get to the end. Don't click anything as it will then pop up with the keys. Click download. Now we can go to the vps we created (or pre-existed) and start with the docker setup and eventually rclone. Install dooker with: curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh sh get-docker.sh sudo apt-get install docker-compose Once that is installed pull the jellyfin docker image docker pull jellyfin/jellyfin Create 3 folders in a jellyfin folder. I like mine to be like the below (dont worry about that file, that's next) . \u2514\u2500\u2500 docker \u2514\u2500\u2500 jellyfin \u251c\u2500\u2500 docker-compose.yml \u2514\u2500\u2500 files \u251c\u2500\u2500 cache \u251c\u2500\u2500 config \u2514\u2500\u2500 media 6 directories, 1 file Create a file called docker-compose.yml and paste the below in to it: (anything encased in <> should be changed to map to your folders) version: \"3\" services: jellyfin: image: jellyfin/jellyfin user: 1000:1000 network_mode: \"host\" volumes: - </path/to/config>:/config - </path/to/cache>:/cache - </path/to/media>:/media Now we need to sort the rclone business out. For this I suggest using screen. It can be opened by typing screen in a shell session (over ssh to the server) If it opens, close it with Ctrl + a + d (the a key followed by the d key) If it gives you shit about not having it installed run sudo apt-get install screen -y Now we need to setup rclone cd ~/.config mkdir rclone cd rclone nano rclone.conf [media] type = s3 env_auth = access_key_id = <first key in .csv file from user creation> secret_access_key = <second key from user creation> region = endpoint = https://s3.eu-central-1.wasabisys.com #if using a europe bucket, else; See below for specifics location_constraint = acl = server_side_encryption = storage_class = ####You dont need to copy this shit in to the file, it's in reference to line 7### #Wasabi US East 1 (N. Virginia): s3.wasabisys.com or s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com #Wasabi US East 2 (N. Virginia): s3.us-east-2.wasabisys.com #Wasabi US West 1 (Oregon): s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com #Wasabi EU Central 1 (Amsterdam): s3.eu-central-1.wasabisys.com Test this by going to the wasabi interface and uploading something to the bucket. then do rclone ls media:<bucket name, probably jeff> Should return the file name. If you have issues, contact me. You can email me at the webmaster email address and I'll be happy to help where I can. Next we need to map the bucket to a folder. Open screen by typing screen Change directory to the media folder you created erlier and run: rclone mount media:<bucket name> media --allow-others It may throw back an error about using --allow-others, but just do what the command says and edit the file, remove the # in from of the allow_others or what's closest in the file. It should return nothing if it worked. Press ctrl + a + d try ls on the media folder. We should see the file we uploaded from earlier. Now we can build the jellyfin docker image what's it. In the folder where the docker-compose.yml file exists, run: docker-compose up If all went well it should spin up and then you can visit the IP address for the vm you're working on with the jellyfin port number and then add the media like you would usually: I suggest you create the folders though wasabi webui and upload the files there if you're not 100% with rclone.

First, generate your keypair, I generally name the keys with my username-service, username-hostname, or username-device, sometimes even a combination of the three. To generate keys for a new server at securedomain.com ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C 'email@securedomain.com' Things to keep in mind: The email does not have to be the same domain as the service/server you are connecting to The -t rsa -b 4096 options are safe and will work on most servers, you can also use -t ed25519 if you wish. Once you're in the ssh-keygen prompt it will ask you to provide a name for your keys (you can also do this in the command itself using the -f <filename> ) Generating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa): <new_key_name> The ssh-keygen application will then, prompt you for a passphrase to secure your key. (You don't have to, but it is recommended). If you don't wish to use a passphrase just press ENTER twice. Now, we need to copy our keys to the server, we do so by entering the following ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/yourkeyfile username@hostname This will effectively copy your keyfile over to the new server in a secure fashion. More reading on this here. Next, you will want to add the key to your .ssh/config to be used automatically with the specified host it was created for; this saves the leg work of having to remember which key goes with which host, and also from having to type -i /path/to/key options with your ssh command. To do this, first we need to edit our config, so open up .ssh/config in your preferred editor and enter the following: # EXAMPLE # This will setup the use of example as an alias for the FQDN of the server you want to connect to Host example Hostname example.securedomain.com AddKeysToAgent yes UseKeychain yes IdentityFile ~/.ssh/securedomain_username In this config the following are true: Host is an alias to the server we wish to connect to, it does not have to match the domain name. Hostname is the actual FQDN of the server we wish to connect to AddKeysToAgent tells ssh to add the specified keyfiles to our existing s sh-agent UseKeychain tells ssh to utilize the keychain , which either starts the ssh-agent, or connects to an already running instance saving the trouble of typing the passphrase for a given key if you're logging in and out of a server frequently. IdentityFile is your keyfile you wish to use for the host you are configuring; probably the key you just generated. Using this config and example; we can now use the following command ssh user@example Which using this config, in the background is expanded out to the following command ssh -i ~/.ssh/securedomain_username user@example.securedomain.com","title":"SSH client setup using keys"},{"location":"kb/ssh/ssh-keys/","text":"generate SSH keys and copy them to host On the host you are logged in to, but want to ssh to another host with no password run the below ssh-keygen -t ed25519 Copy them to server then run this but put the server name where it asks for remote host.
