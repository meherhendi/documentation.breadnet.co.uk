# [breadNET Documentation](https://documentation.breadnet.co.uk)

This repo houses all the public documentation that I have created over the years, recently migrated to mkdocs

## Why `mkdocs`

I have decided to go with `mkdocs` as it has a really easy to use admin interface.

That was a joke. The real reason is the lack of admin interface. It reduces the attack vector and also means that I can
edit the files anywhere I have access to git.

I hardly find my self editing files away from home, so I'm not too stressed.

## Why Migrate

As mentioned, I am fed-up with Bookstack and administering it.

I love Bookstack. 100% - But the issue is I have outgrown the need to have a full-fledged CMS with user permissions etc.

I think this is just me getting more mature and resizing that a full CMS is not needed. 

# Contribute

I encourage people to contribute to this. 

You can do so by making a fork of this to your own account, making the changes and then open a PR in to DEV.
